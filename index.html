          <h1 class="pt-5">Charting Covid Data</h1>
          <hr class="sep">
          <h3>The App</h3>
          <hr class="sep-light">
          <p>Created a web application using Flask Framework and an API to gather real-time data of active and total cases of Covid per Country. As well as total deaths and total recoveries.</p>
          <img src="/Master/images/CovidDataAPP.png" alt="Screenshot of Covid Real Time Data Application" class="img-fluid">
          <h3>Challenges</h3>
          <hr class="sep-light">
          <p>The main challenge of this application was to dynamically create the chart based on the country selected. As in order to do that, we need to gather user input and validate if the country matches the list of countries the API used provides.</p>
          <p>Once the searching is completed and the data of the requested country is received. We would have to extract the data provided by the API meaningfully and use the data provided to generate a chart.</p>
          <hr class="sep-light">
          <h3>Future Improvements</h3>
          <hr class="sep-light">
          <p>I am currently working on adding an SQLAlchemy database to store all of the data received from the API which will allow me to extract the data directly from a database.
            This will help to achieve creating a chart where more than one country's data can be viewed by adding multiple datasets to the chart.
          </p>
          <p>Create a search system to provide suggestions, essentially providing an auto-complete system for users to find the country easier.</p>

          <hr class="sep">
          <h3>The App</h3>
          <hr class="sep-light">
          <p>Created a Weather App which receivs user input with City, State(Optional), and Country. Once the user input is received, the application provides real-time weather data of the location.</p>
          <img src="/Master/images/WeatherApp.png" alt="Screenshot of Weather Application providing real time weather data" class="img-fluid">
          <h3>Challenges</h3>
          <hr class="sep-light">
          <p>The main challange of this application was to request appropriate data. Unlike the Covid Data Application, the API provides the data based on your request.
            Once the data is received, used the flask framework to provide separate location data based on whether the optional input of State was provided.
          </p>
          <hr class="sep-light">
          <h3>Future Improvements</h3>
          <p>I will be adding error handling when the city is not found. Additionally, will be adding feature to automatically gather user location to provide real time weather data.</p>
          <p>I will additionally create a database to handle weather data requests. Weather data is only updated every 10-15 minutes. Why should we not provide the existing data rather than creating the same request.</p>

          <h3>Challenges</h3>
          <hr class="sep-light">
          <p>Prior to creating any website, you have to work on hosting your website. Once I had my hosting ready, I made sure to use proper frameworks such as BootStrap to make my website responsive for both Desktop and Mobile. </p>
          <p>Used JQuery framework to create animations to switch page content information without actually ever leaving the page.</p>
          <p>Created a simplistic layout for my webpage utilizing the tools given to me by BootStrap and CSS</p>

          <h3>Future Improvements</h3>
          <hr class="sep-light">
          <p>Create a login system to my website for myself to update anyone about my life for anyone who would like to see it.</p>
